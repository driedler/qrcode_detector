# QR Code Detector

This is Python wrapper for [QR-Code Scanner](https://github.com/PhilS94/QR-Code-Scanner):

> A QR-Code Scanner, written in C++ and using the OpenCV library, which was developed as an optional part of the university course "Computer Vision" in a small team of three.

This implementation works __substantially__ better than the `QRCodeDetector` that comes with OpenCV.


## Usage

```python

import qrcode_detector



```
